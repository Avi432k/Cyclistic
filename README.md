This is a project completed for a fictional bike-share company, Cyclistic. The company has two types of customers, annual members (customers who purchase annual memberships) and casual riders (customers who purchase single or full-day passes). Previous analysis showed that annual members are far more profitable, so the goal of this project is to analyse historical bike trip data to understand how annual members and casual riders differ, and thus, convert casual riders to annual members.
